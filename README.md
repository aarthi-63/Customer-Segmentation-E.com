## Project Overview
**Objective :** 
To segment e-commerce customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors and demographics, facilitating targeted marketing and improved customer engagement

## Methodology:
**Data Collection & Preprocessing:** 
Gather customer data, including purchase history, demographics, and browsing behavior. Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and standardize formats.

**Feature Selection :** 

Identify key features for segmentation, such as:
- **Recency :** Time since the last purchase.
- **Frequency :** Number of purchases in a given period.
- **Monetary :** Total spending over a period.

**Segmentation Techniques :**

Apply clustering algorithms like K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering to group customers based on the selected features.

**Evaluation & Visualization :** 

Assess the quality of clusters using metrics like the silhouette score. Visualize the clusters to interpret and label them meaningfully.
